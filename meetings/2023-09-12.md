## Ryan on AI with aider
- https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider
- Make a quick Flask app for a blog
- Prompted to make modifications
- aider can explain each modification it makes
- aidr can explain code.  E.g. "Explain app.py in detail"
- Ryan - [ReLLM](https://github.com/r2d4/rellm): Regular Expressions for Language Model Completions
- Eugene asked about aider formatting/linting (it doesn't do it)
- Ryan - Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) externally
- Patrick - vscode has a good plugin for formatting/format-on-save
- Ryan: aider to write tests
    - "Write a complete set of unit tests for app.py"
    - You can also use pytest
- Ryan: aider is best used for creating boilerplate.  You'll get to a point of diminishing returns where it's easier to write it yourself than to figure out the exact prompt to get AI to do what you're thinking.

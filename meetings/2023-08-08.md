## Ryan
Ryan talked about converting https://github.com/MxDkl/pls into Python in order to help translate natural language into command line things.

## Scott
Scott asked about using ChatGPT to parse Slack conversations and create tasks.

Things to research:
* https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
* [ChatGPT playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) is free to test out prompts and inputs
* gpt-3.5-turbo is the cheapest model
* https://github.com/openai/tiktoken
* Alternative: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/slack

## Tim
Tim asked about creating some kind of test case "thing" to bolt on to his existing framework
* Tim doesn't like Robotframework
    - too heavy
    - doesn't want to write too much "non Python" stuff
* Want's something basic to describe/run test cases

Things to research:
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/nonpython.html)
* [hypothesis api testing](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#fuzzing-an-http-api)
* [hitch](https://github.com/hitchtest/hitch) might be an alternative to robotframework
* [mimesis](https://mimesis.name)
* [taverntesting](https://taverntesting.github.io/)

## Dillon
Dillon's looking for a step-by-step guide for creating LLMs

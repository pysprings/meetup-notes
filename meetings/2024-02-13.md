## General discussion

After introductions, Dave introduced us to "Sampling Cavity" and sharing with Jupyter Notebooks w/ plots.  Visualizations helped Dave conceptualize a complex 3D problem space.

Hannan talked about using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), a framework for building Large Language Models.

Eugene gave a demo using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) to communicate with ChatGPT.

Tim showed an example of a `for:else` loop and the builtin [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) module.

        Should that be narrowed down to tech doc writing in English?

        Typically GPT-4 and 3.5 will just do stuff in the language of the prompt if otherwise specified.

        The new memory feature isn't implemented for me yet, but it's probably a function call.

        getitem aDict[key]
        setitem: aDict[key] = foo
    Eugene
        Gave prompt in Russian to write the same things but specifically returned answers in English. Asked question in Russian too, answers were in English. Works as described above, but need to be careful with prompt.

        Tim's sound choppy - or just my system?
    Eugene

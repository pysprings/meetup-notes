## General discussion

Ryan gave a quick presentation on [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and how it relates to frontend/backend development.

Dn breifly mentioned [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) and we discussed the various approaches to solving the "I don't want to write JavaScript" problem.

Tim mentioned [textual-web](https://github.com/Textualize/textual-web) as an up-and-coming contender (and Dn mentioned that a Textual dev meets w/ the NZ Python group).

Dave showcased a spline generator using NumPy based on a published paper.

We then had great discussions covering topics of SOLID, project management, teams, and development!
